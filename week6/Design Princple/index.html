  <h1>Focusing on Design Principle: Rule of Thirds</h1>
  <div class="wrapper1">
    <div class="description">
      <p>The following section has divs that are evenly distributed.  Their widths are all exactly
      the same at 300px.  While they all uniform, the design principle of the rule of thirds shows us
    that we should reduce the amount of columns within our webpage for more aesthtic value to the user. </p>
