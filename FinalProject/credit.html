        <h2>Understanding Credit</h2>
        <p>Credit is a topic of much opinion.  Some feel credit is bad and should
           stay away from it.  Others say it is necessary.  Whichever side you
           fall on, one truth rings true.  Credit is important.  In this day
           and age it is nearly impossible to accomplish anything without
           having credit established.  The true idea behind credit is creating
           a snapshot of you as a borrower.  Itâ€™s creating an overall picture
           and seeing if you are a trustworthy individual.</p>

           <p>Nowadays even apartment complexes are not approving housing for
             individuals unless they have credit established.  Car insurance
             companies provide different rates based on your credit.  They see
             it as, how likely will this person pay me for the services provided.</p>

             <p>Credit is established through borrowing.  There are many types
               of loans available to help you gain credit.  Credit is also
               established by not paying.  This is to say, that if you have
               monthly obligations such as rent or a cable bill and just decide
               to stop paying, those companies will take action and report you
               to collection agencies, which then in turn will report your
               situation to the credit bureaus.  This simply states that paying
               your bills does nothing for your credit, but not paying your bills
                will drastically change your credit snapshot.</p>

            <p>There are resources created to help you keep an eye on your credit.
                They are meant to help you be vigilant.  Your credit will directly
                 impact your rates you qualify for when borrowing money, and in
                 certain situations, may be a cause of why you might not be
                 approved.  This is especially true if you have many unpaid
                 bills or a lack of credit established.</p>

            <p>Included on this page is an assortment of resources to help you
              understand the difference between credit and debit, gain more
              understanding in establishing credit, and understand how credit
              reports are compiled.</p>
