        <h2>Understanding Loans</h2>
        <p>This part of the blog is focused on understanding lending.  Whether
          you have had a loan before or will be looking to take out your first
          loan, it is my hope that this section will give you some insight as to
           what you may or may not know.  There are a multitude of loans that
           one may look into and in that regard a multitude of ways to accomplish
           your goal.</p>

           <p>Needing to borrow money and owing is a common fear.  As described on
           the credit page, there is a common fear with credit.  There were many
           generations that grew up thinking that everything should be paid in
           cash and you should never have to owe.  There was a time and a place
           in the world in which that was a feasible option, but in today’s
           society, if someone does not establish credit it can make things a
           lot more difficult for that time you will end up needing to borrow
           money.</p>

           <p>One of the most common ways to establish credit quickly is by having
           revolving debt.  This is another way of saying, having a credit card.
           A credit card is considered revolving because it can be used, paid
           off, and used again.  Other loan types are termed, meaning that you
           borrow a lump sum of money, and pay it off over an agreed upon term
           of time.</p>

           <p>Borrowing money and paying loans back help to build that credit.
           When taking out loans, your credit will directly impact what kind of
           rate you may receive.  The lack of credit or poor credit may have you
            paying back a loan with a higher interest rate.  The more established
             and better your credit, the lower the rate.  It is easy to get upset
             with this idea, as it would seem someone who has worse credit my
             need more help.  It is the idea however that interest rates are
             commonly associated with risk.  This means that the riskier the
             investment for the financial institution, the higher the rate to
             balance out that risk.  Similarly, if the risk is not as severe
             then the rate will be lower to balance out that risk.</p>

             <p>Loans can be either secured or unsecured.  This means that a loan
             will either have collateral or it won’t.  Collateral is something
             that the loan is being taken out against.  Basically meaning,
             should an individual default on said loan, the collateral now
             becomes the payment and the financial institution has the right to
             the collateral.  Unsecured means that there is nothing to take in
             the event a loan is defaulted on.  Basically state, a car loan is
             secured as it has a car as collateral.  A personal loan to buy
             yourself a vacation is not secured, as you are most likely
             receiving money to make the purchases yourself.  Loans with
             collateral generally have lower rates as they are secured, and
             unsecured loans generally have higher rates to balance the risk of
             default.</p>

               should consider before applying for a loan, help to understand
               APR, and finally tips for considering to borrow money for a car.</p>
